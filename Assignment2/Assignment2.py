#    Assignment 2                                                                                   #
# Your assignment is to use the Datamuse API to generate a predictive text-driven Haiku on a        #
# topic of the userâ€™s choice. Your program should first request that the user provide a topic to    #
# begin the Haiku generation. Then, your program should connect to the Datamuse API to find         #
# related words that satisfy the requirements of a Haiku (described below). Print your completed    #
# Haiku for the user to enjoy. Finally, your program should allow the user to generate as many      #
# Haikus as desired.                                                                                #
